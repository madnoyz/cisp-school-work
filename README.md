Welcome to my playground! I attend Sac State. This hub will be
my educational sandbox. My learning experience will be document here - from 
computer science homework to outside personal projects. 

Employers like what you see, then hire me: clydepabro [at] outlook.com. 

I have broken down the folders to specific programming languages, while the subfolders
will be the individual classes or any specific projects.

Anyone attending Sac State, hit me up! I want to create a study group, play some magic
the gathering, or a few games of league of legends!
