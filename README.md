Welcome to my playground! I go to Folsom Lake College. This hub will be
my educational sandbox. From computer science homework to any other 
programming needs, my learning experience will be here. 

Employers like what you see, then hire me: clydepabro [at] computer.org. 

I have broken down the folders to specific programming languages, while the subfolders
will be the individual classes or any specific projects.

Anyone attending Folsom Lake College, hit me up! Create a study group, play some magic
the gathering, or a few games of league of legends. Let me know!
